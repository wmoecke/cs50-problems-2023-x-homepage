                <p class="card-text">At the center of the entire Original Trilogy, the Falcon rightfully became one of the standout icons of the Sequel Trilogy, too.
                    The Falcon spans much of the film saga, and if you delve into the Expanded Universe, it has quite the history of names, paint jobs, and owners.
                    Most famously, Lando Calrissian lost the ship to Han Solo in a card game.
                    And while you’ll sometimes wonder why so many people cherish this “garbage” ship, as Rey so eloquently puts it in The Force Awakens, the Falcon always
                    has some surprises left in her sweetheart, including secret storage compartments underneath the floor panels and twin AG-2G quad laser cannons that
                    more than make up for the ship’s very moody hyperdrive.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Star Destroyer</h5>
                <p class="card-text">A Star Destroyer was a dagger-shaped type of capital ship that were used by the Galactic Republic, the Galactic Empire, the First Order,
                    and the Sith Eternal. Notable examples of Star Destroyers include the Imperial-class Star Destroyer and its predecessor, the Venator-class Star Destroyer.
                    According to Everi Chalis, Star Destroyers were the most resource-intensive ships the galaxy had ever seen, and only Kuat possessed shipyards that were
                    capable of supporting and maintaining more than a handful at a time.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">TIE Fighter</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Few can forget the cry of a TIE fighter, as it zooms over their heads or right at them at dangerous speeds. Although it is absolutely
                    the Empire’s most expendable starship, it is also its most iconic. The original TIE fighters from A New Hope were white in color, while the ones in Empire
                    and Jedi were a bit grayer, with blue-ish hues. The signature shriek of the fighter was created by combining an elephant’s scream with the sound of a car
                    driving on a wet road.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">X-Wing</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Since the starship battles in A New Hope were modeled after real-world dogfights, X-wings fit the role of the quick, darting fighter
                    planes that fought in them. Their maneuverability and the split wings that match the X in their name make them one of the coolest starship designs in
                    Star Wars, utilized by the heroes of both the Original Trilogy and The Force Awakens. Poe Dameron’s black-and-orange T-70 is the evolution of the classic
                    T-65, with the same sharp ferocity. The X-wing is the ship of heroes, and it looks the part.</p>
