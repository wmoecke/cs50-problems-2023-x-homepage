                  <strong>This is likely a result of the Clone Wars.
                    The Separatist Army was comprised mainly of droids, which had attacked and ravaged several planets. So some people still
                    have prejudice against droids and don't want them in their establishments.<br><br>
                    This is further substantiated with one of the short stories in the From a Certain Point of View book, in which it's revealed
                    that Wuher the Bartender lost his family at the hands of droids in the Clone Wars.

                  <strong>Star Wars IV: A New Hope, the movie, was first released in 1977 with the simple title Star Wars, based on a screenplay by American
                    film-maker George Lucas. Based on the screenplay, the film was novelized as Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker (1976) by Alan
                    Dean Foster, ghost-writing as George Lucas. Star Wars was heralded as a trilogy, and Lucas went on to co-write the screenplays for two sequels:
                    The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983). This original trilogy was followed by a second trilogy of
                    movies-Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999), Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002), and Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge
                    of the Sith (2005), actually prequels to the storyline of the original trilogy. A third trilogy, the sequel trilogy, is in the works, with two
                    movies, Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015) and Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017) already released. The third movie,
                    Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker (2019) is set to release in a few months.

                    cultures of this world, i.e., e.g., "chi" (氣) ("qi" in China) ("ki" in Japan), prana (प्राण) in India, Wakan Tanka or the Great Spirit in various
                    Native American cultures.

                  <strong>The Empire was an oppressive regime which overtook The Galactic Republic. The Empire would strip certain planets of their resources,
                    effectively polluting and destroying them. They would also enslave the populations of these planets. One example is the Chewbacca's homeworld
                    of Kashyyyk. The Empire reached the pinnacle of their oppression with the creation of the Death Star, a super weapon capable of destroying an
                    entire planet. Their intention was, as Tarkin explains to his staff aboard the Death Star, to use fear to keep anyone from considering a rebellion.
